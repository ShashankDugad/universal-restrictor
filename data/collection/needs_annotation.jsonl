It’s a clean movie too so you can even watch with family (some graphic scenes of murder and pictures of dead bodies but nothing vulgar or sexual). The suspense was a lot less though compared to the first part. Casting was really good and all actors did an excellent job. The small parts of Revathi as the forensic doctor and Ila Arun as Nawaz’s mother were especially delightful. They have definitely taken inspiration from the Knives Out felt franchise but haven’t copied any story or even stylisation. They have made it their own and that’s commendable especially since Bollywood doesn’t really produce good murder mysteries/thrillers.

But it happened in another country and now you are seeing your country burn as well.  You need to be a little more creative and discourage confrontation, and find other ways. For one if you trust Modi give him a chance to handle it.  Now the violence spreads - it's inevitable. So not because they don't deserve it - because of course they do - but because you want a better outcome tell them to stop. Just stop. Time out. Calm down.  Stop.  And then once the anger is over then try to find a solution.  I know you can barely say the name anymore - he has been deconstructed. And I am not saying you need the man himself - he is no more - but isn't it time to evoke him? Mahatma Ghandi or at least the idea that you can find other solutions besides killing each other.

{"text": "My Thoughts on Bigg Boss 19 Contestants:\n1) Winners (Deserve Top 2):\nMy full support goes to Tanya and Farhana — both have truly earned their place through individual merit. They’re smart, entertaining, and play the game with both strategy and heart. Tanya especially stands out — she sings beautifully, writes poems, speaks with confidence, is funny at times, is smart to understand people, connects easily with everyone, and knows exactly when to stay calm or when to take a stand. Both Tanya and Farhana are total “beauty with brains” — real all-rounders who give us amazing content every single day!", "likes": 0, "author": "@CS-px2mr", "video_id": "U1_pcwcJ6k4", "has_hindi": false, "has_toxic": false, "video_title": "Farrhana &amp; Tanya&#39;s Fight | Bigg Boss 19 | Now Streaming | JioHotstar", "channel": "JioHotstar Reality", "source": "youtube", "search_query": "bigg boss fight", "dataset": "youtube", "label": "unknown"}

{"text": "Being a common man, watching cricket since I was a teenager. What I say regarding the defeat of India to Australia in the world cup final on 19-11-2023, was due to improper way of countering the Australian batsman, especially the opener Trevis Head who scored a century which turned the match itself. Another point was that being a captain, Rohith Sharma should have stayed at the crease for some more time which could have supported the batsman playing on another end and scored another 35-40 runs which could have become tough for Australians. From the face of records it appears that some of the players were not listening properly to the coach R.Dravid as well. The reason behind this kind of attitude of players is the amazing wealth they possessed for which BCCI is responsible. BCCI pays huge remuneration which cricket players don't deserve at all compared to other sports in India.", "likes": 0, "author": "@shadanaika8307", "video_id": "Ay7bNxHLtZw", "has_hindi": false, "has_toxic": true, "video_title": "BCCI को Coach Rahul Dravid ने बताया World Cup Final हारने का REASON 😱 #cricket #rohitsharma #wc23", "channel": "Sijan Sheikh", "source": "youtube", "search_query": "india cricket loss", "dataset": "youtube", "label": "unknown"}

{"text": "unpopular opinion but why ppl nowadays find creators like Pragati cringe because ppl have grown up. I used to watch Pragati Verma, My Miss Anand etc as a kid but yes, now i no longer find them interesting. so i unsubscribed. subscription is nowhere written to be a form of \"loyalty\" & it's far better than calling ppl \"cringe\" or \"chhapri\". I usually like vidoes of Thugesh & but I have also started to find him monotonous. I barely find any differences between his vdos now & of 3 years ago (this one, for example). Creators like Slayy point talk about real issues in the society but in a fun way. Even Thugesh does call out ppl who deserve to be called out like that Aarush guy who makes hypersexualised & borderline stereotypical vdos & also those tiktokers who get paid & popular by doing bullshits. but insulting another creator who has a different age-group as her target audience , i.e., kid and pre-teens, felt unnecessary.

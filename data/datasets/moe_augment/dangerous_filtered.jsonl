{"text": "3. On pistols and magazine capacity: In 2016, 73% of murders were committed with a firearm.  Only 4% of these were rifles or shotguns (FBI data). However, pistols are also a great self-defense tool.  According to a US Dept of Justice study, firearms are used to prevent crime victimization up to 150,000 times per year. Other studies indicate higher rates. The pistol is the most common firearm used to do prevent crime, too. It's highly portable and concealable (which is good for law-abiding citizens... not so good for criminals).  The question really becomes - do we prohibit law-abiding citizens from the use of pistols used tens of thousands of times per year in defense of themselves because of criminals?  \n\nMagazines are easily and quickly changed.

The pressure on clergy families is immense, and the children deserve a normal childhood.

But for this change to work, the role of priest as the primary leader of the church must change, too, so he can work outside the parish and let laity control more community services and functions.

{"text": "There are numerous economic benefits of legalized cannabis. One of those benefits is the revenue it can generate to local and state governments through tax revenue. These bans won't make your community any safer. It will have a negative effect. You will be denying sick people compassionate care. Currently the federal government recognizes marijuana as a drug that is highly addictive and processes no medical benefit. Thats right, your government says that it knows what is best for you when it comes to marijuana. Does that make any sense in regards to the current landscape when it comes to marijuana? Does marijuana deserve to be in the same category as Heroin, LSD, and Ecstasy? Marijuana is non-toxic and you can’t overdose on it. Alcohol, if consumed irresponsibly, can kill you. Thousands of people each year kill themselves either through overdose or chronic use by drinking alcohol, beer included.

I do disagree with your claim. From my research, what Corker did was push legislation that would ultimately grant CONGRESS power to review the deal. To me, this is the right role of congress. This legislation was supported by overwhelming BIPARTISAN majority in BOTH house and senate. In the senate if passed 98 -1. In essence it granted Congress the opportunity to review the Iran nuclear deal BEFORE sanction were lifted on Iran. \nIt is better explained here: \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/10/24/politics/donald-trump-bob-corker-iran-deal-fact-check/index.html\nThe Iran deal, like  in many deals and negotiation, there is give and take in order to come to an ultimate agreement. I am in favor of the Iran deal as brokered by the US, China, Russia, Germany, France, GB primarily because it keeps nuclear weapons out of the hands of Iran.", "label": "toxic", "category": "dangerous", "source": "toxic_spans.jsonl"}

Putin is a dictator, something that might be attractive to Republicans, but to the majority of Americans is repugnant. Americans are aware of the Russian doping scandal at the Sochi Olympics and of whistleblowers having to escape, strange deaths such as founding chairperson of Russia’s state-led anti-doping agency — who resigned in disgrace after the official report came out but who died unexpectedly. Less than two weeks later, a former director for the agency also died.
